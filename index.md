I help organisations improve the quality of their services, and decrease the cost of providing them. I use service design and product management skills to find out the real problems of users and organisations, and get people to prioritise fixing them.

I'm a senior product manager, working in London at the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/). In 2017, I set up a team helping civil servants across government to assess the impact of Brexit on public services. We give them greater context around their projects, to help organisations make better decisions about keeping services running.

I used to be a strategy consultant at [Fjord](https://www.fjordnet.com/) and [Hiveworks](https://www.hiveworks.com/). I was also a product consultant at [EY-Seren](https://www.ey-seren.com/). When I have some free time, I advise the [Service Design Fringe Festival](https://www.sd-ldf.com/).
