I'm an experienced product manager in CopenhagenÂ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°

I help organisations create effective products, built for their customers. I like building products for environmental or social impact.

In the UK government, I launched [GOV.UK Forms](https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/), coached GovTech startups on product management, and helped keep services running after Brexit.

I care about how teams work as much as what teams build. To improve equity in product and design communities, I helped grow a mentoring programme for people from underrepresented groups, benchmarked community demographics and made community sessions more inclusive.

Previously, as a consultant, I advised executives across different sectors on product, digital transformation, customer experience and service design. I worked with EY and Accenture, as well as smaller agencies inÂ London.
