## How I ended up here

I always wanted to be an architect when I was younger, but I didn't get into my chosen school. I ended up studying industrial design, and quickly realised I didn't care much for radiuses or chamfers of products.

I found service design and felt it gave me a more relevant skillset, compared to product design, given that over 80% of the UK's GDP comes from services, yet so many are designed with such little thought, making them complex to use, and costly to manage.

More recently, I've been frustrated with the lack of responsibility that service designers have. If a service is bad, nobody blames the service designer. In some ways this is liberating, but it makes it very easy to be the person that points out service failure, without thinking about the cost of change.

To allow myself to take more responsibility, I've been learning product management, which has helped me have a ruthless focus on maximising value for users and for organisations.

I now see myself as having these two skillsets that I can apply, depending on the situation. I like to highlight service failure caused by complexity, but I also like to help teams prioritise smaller improvements, that will reduce these failures in the future.
